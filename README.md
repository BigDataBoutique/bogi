# Bogi - REST over HTTP(S) testing tool

Bogi's goal is to allow testing HTTP(S) endpoints and services end-to-end.

Bogi generally follows JetBrains' [HTTP Request in Editor spec](https://github.com/JetBrains/http-request-in-editor-spec/blob/master/spec.md), which defines a nice and easy way to describe REST over HTTP actions and the expected return. Bogi might implement extensions to the spec to add functionality.
